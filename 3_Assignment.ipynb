    "1. Why are functions advantageous to have in your programs?\n",
    "\n",
    "ANS: Main advantages of the function is program reusability that why from look like short and clean.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. When does the code in a function run: when it's specified or when it's called?\n",
    "\n",
    "ANS:The code in a function executes when the function is called, not when the function is defined.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. What statement creates a function?\n",
    "\n",
    "ANS:The 'def' statement create function\n",
    "\n",
    "4. What is the difference between a function and a function call?\n",
    "\n",
    "ANS: Function: Function is def statement and code the for further process.\n",
    "\n",
    "Function Call:Fucntion it specific function name that call the function and after exectiing fucntion it will return a value.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. How many global scopes are there in a Python program? How many local scopes?\n",
    "\n",
    "ANS:There is one global scope and local scopes when the function call.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. What happens to variables in a local scope when the function call returns?\n",
    "\n",
    "ANS:When the function call return local scope variable vanish his memory or we can say that it destroy his value.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. What is the concept of a return value? Is it possible to have a return value in an expression?\n",
    "\n",
    "ANS:A return value is the value that a function call evaluates to. Like any value, a return value can be used as part of an expression.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. If a function does not have a return statement, what is the return value of a call to that function?\n",
    "\n",
    "ANS:If there is no return value then it will return None/null value. \n",
    "\n",
    "9. How do you make a function variable refer to the global variable?\n",
    "\n",
    "ANS:A global statement will force a variable in a function to refer to the global variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "10. What is the data type of None?\n",
    "\n",
    "ANS: Data type of None is NoneType\n",

    "\n",
    "ANS:This function can be called with spam.bacon().\n",
    "\n",
    "13. What can you do to save a programme from crashing if it encounters an error?\n",
    "\n",
    "ANS:We use the try and except statements to handle exceptions. Whenever the code breaks down, an exception is thrown without crashing the program.\n",
